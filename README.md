## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Basic Workflow:
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer to 25 minutes (work session)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After 4 work sessions, take a longer break (15 minutes)

## Browser Compatibility

This timer works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 Classes
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties
- Web Notifications API (optional)
